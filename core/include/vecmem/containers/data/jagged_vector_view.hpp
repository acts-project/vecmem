     * @brief A view for jagged vectors.
     *
     * A jagged vector is a two-dimensional vector in which the inner vectors do
     * not necessarily have the same size. For example, a jagged vector might
     * look like this:
     *
     * [[0, 1, 2],
     *  [3, 4],
     *  [],
     *  [5, 6, 7]]
     *
     * This class is a view of existing two-dimensional vectors created using a
     * vector-of-vectors formalism. Elements cannot be added or removed through
     * this view, but individual elements can be accessed and modified.
     *
     * @warning This view class shares memory with the vectors from which it was
     * constructed. Operating on the underlying vectors while an instance of
     * this class exists deriving from it is undefined and may leave the view in
     * an undefined state.
